/// We need this lovely construct because
/// - We want to store `Weak<StrongHandle>` as our index, since we can upgrade it to a strong handle when needed.
///   - We don't store `Handle` directly because we don't want to keep a strong reference to the asset.
///   - Keeping the asset alive is the user's choice, not the library's.
///   - We cannot store an `AssetId` instead because inserting into a dropped asset ID will cause Bevy to hit "unreachable" code lol
/// - But `Weak<StrongHandle>` is not `Eq`!!!
///   - We could use a `Vec<(A, B)>` instead of a `HashMap`, but the code in [`NavmeshGenerator::regenerate`] also wants an eq check.
///
/// So, we build this bad boi ourselves :bavy:
