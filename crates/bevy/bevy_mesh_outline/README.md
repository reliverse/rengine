This plugin provides outline rendering for 3D meshes using a multi-pass GPU approach with JFA *(jump flood algorithm)* for distance field generation.

## Features

- **GPU-optimized rendering** - Uses compute-based jump flood algorithm for efficient and smooth outline generation
- **Customizable outlines** - Control width, color, intensity, and priority per mesh
- **Depth-aware rendering** - Outlines respect depth relationships and handle intersecting geometry
- **HDR support** - Works with both standard and HDR rendering pipelines
- **Animation-friendly** - Supports animated meshes, skinning, and morph targets


## Components

### `MeshOutline`

Add this component to any entity with a `Mesh3d` to enable outline rendering:

```rust
// Basic outline
MeshOutline::new(width)

// Customized outline
MeshOutline::new(10.0)
    .with_color(Color::srgb(1.0, 0.0, 0.0))  // Red outline
    .with_intensity(0.8)                     // 80% strength
    .with_priority(5.0)                      // Higher priority (for overlapping outlines)
```

**Properties:**
- `width: f32` - Outline width in pixels
- `color: Color` - Outline color (supports HDR colors)
- `intensity: f32` - Outline intensity (0.0 to 1.0+)
- `priority: f32` - Rendering priority for overlapping outlines (higher = front)

### `OutlineCamera`

Mark cameras that should render outlines:


> [!NOTE]  
> The rendering pipeline currently does not support MSAA and will only work on cameras where it is disabled.

```rust
commands.spawn((
    Camera3d::default(),
    OutlineCamera, // Enable outline rendering for this camera
    DepthPrepass,  // Required for proper depth testing
    Msaa::Off, // Disable MSAA
));
```


## Examples

Run the included examples to see the plugin in action:

```bash
# Basic rotating cube with adjustable outline width
cargo run --example simple

# Glowing effect example (HDR)
cargo run --example glowing

# Animated character with outlines
cargo run --example animated_mesh

# Multiple intersecting objects with priority control
cargo run --example intersecting
```

## How It Works

The plugin uses a three-pass GPU rendering approach:

1. **Mask Pass** - Renders outlined meshes to generate seed data and depth information
2. **Jump Flood Algorithm** - Efficiently propagates outline information across the screen using compute shaders
3. **Compose Pass** - Combines the original scene with the computed outline effect by comparing against outline depth

This approach provides:
- Consistent outline width regardless of mesh geometry
- Proper handling of intersecting objects through priority system
- Support for complex mesh features (skinning, morph targets)


## Technical Details

The plugin integrates with Bevy's render graph and adds a custom render node after the main 3D pass. It requires depth prepass to be enabled for proper depth-aware outline rendering.

Outline data is packed into GPU textures using a flood-fill algorithm that efficiently calculates distance fields for smooth, consistent outline rendering across different mesh topologies.
